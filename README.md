wg-api is an API endpoint for a Wireguard® VPN server. It allows you to make HTTP GET requests with JSON responses, enabling you to create & revoke peers (eg. clients), access QR/plaintext/JSON config files and receive realtime server info.

It also currently includes an installer script to configure your Wireguard® interface correctly as per wg-api's construction.

It's still a baby project but I plan on building it out into a full-featured RESTful API for this amazing VPN software. I would **NOT** use this in production for awhile. It is a very insecure endpoint that could and most likely **will** give an attacker access to your user's keys and full control over your system. The only thing securing it currently is an IP-based whitelist in `config.json`. Seriously, don't even think about exposing this as a public IP and/or port.

## Installation

Use a fresh Ubuntu 18.* install with up-to-date apt dependencies, with Node and NPM installed and Wireguard uninstalled.
```bash
apt-get install nodejs npm -y
git clone https://github.com/herukrayz/wg-api
cd wg-api
npm install fastify fastify-static chalk ini
cd ./scripts/bash
./installer.sh
```

Take time to configure the options in `/wg-api/scripts/data/wg.def` and `/wg-api/config.json`.

Then get your Wireguard® server up and running:

```bash
cd ./wg-api/scripts/bash
./wg.sh -g
```

## Running the server

```bash
node server.js
```
